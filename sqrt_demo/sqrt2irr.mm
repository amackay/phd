  Propositional calculus
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about well-formed formulas
  (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  The simplest propositional
  truth is ` ( ph -> ph ) ` , which can be read "if something is true, then it
  is true" - rather trivial and obvious, but nonetheless it must be proved from
  the axioms (see Theorem id
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/id.html
 ).

  Our system of propositional calculus consists of three basic axioms and
  another axiom that defines the modus-ponens inference rule.  It is attributed
  to Jan Lukasiewicz (pronounced woo-kah-SHAY-vitch) and was popularized by
  Alonzo Church, who called it system P2.  (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this
  information.)  These axioms are ax-1
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-1.html
 , ax-2
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-2.html
 , ax-3
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-3.html
 , and (for modus
  ponens) ax-mp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-mp.html
 . Some closely followed texts include [Margaris] for the
  axioms and [WhiteheadRussell] for the theorems.

  The propositional calculus used here is the classical system widely used by
  mathematicians.  In particular, this logic system accepts the "law of the
  excluded middle" as proven in exmid
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/exmid.html
 , which says that a logical statement
  is either true or not true.  This is an essential distinction of classical
  logic and is not a theorem of intuitionistic logic.

  All 194 axioms, definitions, and theorems for propositional calculus in
  _Principia Mathematica_ (specifically *1.2 through *5.75) are axioms or
  formally proven.  See the Bibliographic Cross-References at ~ mmbiblio.html
  for a complete cross-reference from sources used to its formalization in the
  Metamath Proof Explorer.

  $( If ` ph ` is a wff, so is ` -. ph ` or "not ` ph ` ".  Part of the
     recursive definition of a wff (well-formed formula).  In classical logic
     (which is our logic), a wff is interpreted as either true or false.  So if
     ` ph ` is true, then ` -. ph ` is false; if ` ph ` is false, then
     ` -. ph ` is true.  Traditionally, Greek letters are used to represent
     wffs, and we follow this convention.  In propositional calculus, we define
     only wffs built up from other wffs, i.e. there is no starting or "atomic"
     wff.  Later, in predicate calculus, we will extend the basic wff
     definition by including atomic wffs ( weq
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/weq.html
 and wel
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/wel.html
 ). $)
  wn $a wff -. ph $.

  $( If ` ph ` and ` ps ` are wff's, so is ` ( ph -> ps ) ` or " ` ph ` implies
     ` ps ` ".  Part of the recursive definition of a wff.  The resulting wff
     is (interpreted as) false when ` ph ` is true and ` ps ` is false; it is
     true otherwise.  Think of the truth table for an OR gate with input ` ph `
     connected through an inverter.  After we state the axioms of propositional
     calculus ( ax-1
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-1.html
 , ax-2
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-2.html
 , ax-3
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-3.html
 , and ax-mp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-mp.html
 ) and define the
     biconditional ( df-bi
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-bi.html
 ), the constant true ` T. ` ( df-tru
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-tru.html
 ), and the
     constant false ` F. ` ( df-fal
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-fal.html
 ), we will be able to prove these truth
     table values: ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( truimtru
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/truimtru.html
 ),
     ` ( ( T. -> F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( truimfal
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/truimfal.html
 ), ` ( ( F. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     ( falimtru
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/falimtru.html
 ), and ` ( ( F. -> F. ) <-> T. ) ` ( falimfal
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/falimfal.html
 ).  These
     have straightforward meanings, for example, ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     just means "the value of ` ( T. -> T. ) ` is ` T. ` ".

     The left-hand wff is called the antecedent, and the right-hand wff is
     called the consequent.  In the case of ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` , the
     middle ` ps ` may be informally called either an antecedent or part of the
     consequent depending on context.  Contrast with ` <-> ` ( df-bi
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-bi.html
 ),
     ` /\ ` ( df-an
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-an.html
 ), and ` \/ ` ( df-or
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-or.html
 ).

     This is called "material implication" and the arrow is usually read as
     "implies".  However, material implication is not identical to the meaning
     of "implies" in natural language.  For example, the word "implies" may
     suggest a causal relationship in natural language.  Material implication
     does not require any causal relationship.  Also, note that in material
     implication, if the consequent is true then the wff is always true (even
     if the antecedent is false).  Thus, if "implies" means material
     implication, it is true that "if the moon is made of green cheese that
     implies that 5=5" (because 5=5).  Similarly, if the antecedent is false,
     the wff is always true.  Thus, it is true that, "if the moon is made of
     green cheese that implies that 5=7" (because the moon is not actually made
     of green cheese).  A contradiction implies anything ( pm2.21i
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/pm2.21i.html
 ).  In
     short, material implication has a very specific technical definition, and
     misunderstandings of it are sometimes called "paradoxes of logical
     implication". $)

  abbreviation for ` -. ( ( ph -> ps ) -> -. ( ps -> ph ) ) ` .

  Unlike most traditional developments, we have chosen not to have a separate
  symbol such as "Df." to mean "is defined as".  Instead, we will later use the
  biconditional connective for this purpose ( df-an
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-an.html
 is its first use), as it
  allows to use logic to manipulate definitions directly.  This greatly
  simplifies many proofs since it eliminates the need for a separate mechanism
  for introducing and eliminating definitions.

  A note on definitions: definitions are required to be eliminable (that is, a
  theorem stated in terms of the defined symbol can also be stated without it)
  and conservative (that is, a theorem whose statement does not contain the
  defined symbol can be proved without using that definition).  This means that
  a definition does not increase the expressive power nor the deductive power,
  respectively, of a theory.  On the other hand, definitions are often useful
  to write shorter proofs, so in (i)set.mm we will generally not try to avoid
  them.  This is why, for instance, some theorems which do not contain
  disjunction in their statement are placed after the section on disjunction
  because a shorter proof using disjunction is possible.

  Logical conjunction
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This section defines conjunction of two formulas, denoted by infix " ` /\ ` "
  and read "and".  It is defined in terms of implication and negation, which is
  possible in classical logic (but not in intuitionistic logic: see iset.mm).

  After the definition, we briefly introduce conversion of simple expressions
  to and from conjunction.  Two simple operations called importation ( imp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/imp.html
 )
  and exportation ( ~ ex ) follow.  In the propositions-as-types
  interpretation, they correspond to uncurrying and currying respectively. They
  are foundational for this section.  Most of the theorems proved here trace
  back to them, mostly indirectly, in a layered fashion, where more complex
  expressions are built from simpler ones.  Here are some of these successive
  layers:
  importation and exportation,
  commutativity and associativity laws,
  adding antecedents and simplifying,
  conjunction of consequents,
  syllogisms,
  etc.

  As indicated in the "note on definitions" in the section comment for logical
  equivalence, some theorems containing only implication, negation and
  conjunction are placed in the section after disjunction since theirs proofs
  use disjunction (although this is not required since definitions are
  conservative, see said section comment).

  Logical disjunction
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This section defines disjunction of two formulas, denoted by infix " ` \/ ` "
  and read "or".  It is defined in terms of implication and negation, which is
  possible in classical logic (but not in intuitionistic logic: see iset.mm).
  This section contains only theorems proved without df-an
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-an.html
 (theorems that are
  proved using df-an
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-an.html

  help simplifying and applying disjunction are olc

 , orc
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/orc.html
 , and orcom
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/orcom.html
 .

  As mentioned in the "note on definitions" in the section comment for logical
  equivalence, all theorems in this and the previous section can be stated in
  terms of implication and negation only.  Additionally, in classical logic
  (but not in intuitionistic logic: see iset.mm), it is also possible to
  translate conjunction into disjunction and conversely via the De Morgan law
  anor
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/anor.html
 : conjunction and disjunction are dual connectives.  Either is
  sufficient to develop all propositional calculus of the logic (together with
  implication and negation).  In practice, conjunction is more efficient, its
  big advantage being the possibility to use it to group antecedents in a
  convenient way, using imp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/imp.html
 and ~ ex as noted in the previous section.

  An illustration of the conservativity of df-an

  Mixed connectives

  This section gathers theorems of propositional calculus which use (either in
  their statement or proof) mixed connectives (at least conjunction and
  disjunction).

  As noted in the "note on definitions" in the section comment for logical
  equivalence, some theorem statements may contain for instance only
  conjunction or only disjunction, but both definitions are used in their
  proofs to make them shorter (this is exemplified in orim12d

 versus
  orim12dALT
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/orim12dALT.html
 ).  These theorems are mostly grouped at the beginning of this
  section.

  The family of theorems starting with animorl
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/animorl.html
 focus on the relation between
  conjunction and disjunction and can be seen as the starting point of mixed
  connectives in statements.  This sectioning is not rigorously true, since for

  Predicate calculus with equality:  Tarski's system S2 (1 rule, 6 schemes)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  Here we extend the language of wffs with predicate calculus, which allows
  to talk about individual objects in a domain of discourse (which for us will
  be the universe of all sets, so we call them "setvar variables") and make
  true/false statements about predicates, which are relationships between
  objects, such as whether or not two objects are equal.  In addition, we
  introduce universal quantification ("for all", e.g., ax-4
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-4.html
 ) in order to
  make statements about whether a wff holds for every object in the domain of
  discourse.  Later we introduce existential quantification ("there exists",
  df-ex
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-ex.html
 ) which is defined in terms of universal quantification.

  Our axioms are really axiom _schemes_, and our wff and setvar variables are
  metavariables ranging over expressions in an underlying "object language".
  This is explained here:  ~ mmset.html#axiomnote .

  Our axiom system starts with the predicate calculus axiom schemes system S2
  of Tarski defined in his 1965 paper, "A Simplified Formalization of Predicate
  Logic with Identity" [Tarski].  System S2 is defined in the last paragraph on
  p. 77, and repeated on p. 81 of [KalishMontague].  We do not include scheme
  B5 (our sp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sp.html
 ) of system S2 since [KalishMontague] shows it to be logically
  redundant (Lemma 9, p. 87, which we prove as Theorem spw
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/spw.html
 below).

  Theorem spw
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/spw.html
 can be used to prove any _instance_ of sp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sp.html
 having mutually
  distinct setvar variables and no wff metavariables.  However, it seems that
  sp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sp.html
 in its general form cannot be derived from only Tarski's schemes.  We do
  not include B5 i.e. sp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sp.html
 as part of what we call "Tarski's system" because we
  want it to be the smallest set of axioms that is logically complete with
  no redundancies.  We later prove sp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sp.html
 as Theorem ~ axc5 using the auxiliary
  axiom schemes that make our system metalogically complete.

  Our version of Tarski's system S2 consists of propositional calculus
  ( ax-mp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-mp.html
 , ax-1
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-1.html
 , ax-2
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-2.html
 , ax-3
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-3.html
 ) plus ax-gen
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-gen.html
 , ax-4
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-4.html
 , ax-5
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-5.html
 ,
  ax-6
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-6.html
 , ax-7
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-7.html
 , ax-8
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-8.html
 , and ax-9
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-9.html
 .  The last three are equality axioms
  that represent three sub-schemes of Tarski's scheme B8.  Due to its
  side-condition ("where ` ph ` is an atomic formula and ` ps ` is obtained by
  replacing an occurrence of the variable ` x ` by the variable ` y ` "), we
  cannot represent his B8 directly without greatly complicating our scheme
  language, but the simpler schemes ax-7
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-7.html
 , ax-8
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-8.html
 , and ax-9
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-9.html
 are sufficient
  for set theory and much easier to work with.

  Tarski's system is exactly equivalent to the traditional axiom system in most
  logic textbooks but has the advantage of being easy to manipulate with a
  computer program, and its simpler metalogic (with no built-in notions of
  "free variable" and "proper substitution") is arguably easier for a
  non-logician human to follow step by step in a proof (where "follow" means
  being able to identify the substitutions that were made, without necessarily
  a higher-level understanding).  In particular, it is logically complete in
  that it can derive all possible object-language theorems of predicate
  calculus with equality, i.e., the same theorems as the traditional system can
  derive.

  However, for efficiency (and indeed a key feature that makes Metamath
  successful), our system is designed to derive reusable theorem schemes
  (rather than object-language theorems) from other schemes.  From this
  "metalogical" point of view, Tarski's S2 is not complete.  For example, we
  cannot derive scheme sp
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sp.html
 , even though (using spw
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/spw.html
 ) we can derive all
  instances of it that do not involve wff metavariables or bundled setvar
  variables.  (Two setvar variables are "bundled" if they can be substituted
  with the same setvar variable, i.e., do not have a "$d" disjoint variable
  condition.)  Later we will introduce auxiliary axiom schemes ax-10
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-10.html
 ,
  ax-11
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-11.html
 , ax-12
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-12.html
 , and ax-13
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ax-13.html
 that are metatheorems of Tarski's system
  (i.e. are logically redundant) but which give our system the property of
  "scheme completeness", allowing us to prove directly (instead of, say,
  by induction on formula length) all possible schemes that can be expressed in
  our language.

###############################################################################
  ZF (ZERMELO-FRAENKEL) SET THEORY
###############################################################################

  Set theory uses the formalism of propositional and predicate calculus to
  assert properties of arbitrary mathematical objects called "sets".  A set can
  be an element of another set, and this relationship is indicated by the
  ` e. ` symbol.  Starting with the simplest mathematical object, called the
  empty set, set theory builds up more and more complex structures whose
  existence follows from the axioms, eventually resulting in extremely
  complicated sets that we identify with the real numbers and other familiar
  mathematical objects.

  A simplistic concept of sets, sometimes called "naive set theory", is
  vulnerable to a paradox called "Russell's Paradox" ( ru
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ru.html
 ), a discovery that
  revolutionized the foundations of mathematics and logic.  Russell's Paradox
  spawned the development of set theories that countered the paradox, including
  the ZF set theory that is most widely used and is defined here.

  Except for Extensionality, the axioms basically say, "given an arbitrary set
  x (and, in the cases of Replacement and Regularity, provided that an
  antecedent is satisfied), there exists another set y based on or constructed
  from it, with the stated properties".  (The axiom of extensionality can also
  be restated this way as shown by axexte
 ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/axexte.html
 .) The individual axiom links
  provide more detailed descriptions.  We derive the redundant ZF axioms of
  Separation, Null Set, and Pairing from the others as theorems.
